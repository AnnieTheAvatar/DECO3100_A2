            <h2>Why Milk?</h2>
            <p>Milk is one of the most common resources. Over 6 billion people consume milk worldwide! One glass of milk (250ml) is equivalent to 3.8km of driving a car! Milk is one of the main sources of nutrients for growing children, so we should be making
                sure the milk we're feeding the future generations won't continue to polute the Earth. <button id="milky_first_button"><i

                <h3>Water Usage</h3>
                <p>Did you know that producing dairy milk requires a lot of water? Cows, just like us, need water to stay healthy and produce milk. They also need water for their metabolic functions. On top of that, the crops that cows eat, like grass and
                    grains, also need water to grow. All this water adds up and can put a strain on our water resources, especially in areas where water is already scarce. So, it's important for us to be mindful of how much water goes into producing milk.</p>

            <div class="left">
                <h3>Land Usage</h3>
                <p>Another thing to think about is the amount of land needed for milk production. Cows need space to graze and eat grass, and that requires large pastures. Sometimes, forests and other natural habitats are cleared to make room for these pastures.
                    This can harm the environment by contributing to deforestation and the loss of animal homes. Additionally, cows also eat crops like corn and wheat, which require land for cultivation. When more land is used for growing cow food, it
                    can lead to more deforestation and the loss of biodiversity. <button id="milky_second_button"><i

                <p>As you can see, the way we produce milk can have a big impact on our environment. We can also choose milk alternatives, which have a smaller environmental footprint. There are other things we can do to help the environment too! <a href="https://landcareaustralia.org.au/about/what-you-can-do-at-home-or-work-to-get-involved-in-landcare/">Read
