            <h2>Why Milk?</h2>
            <p>Milk is one of the most common resources. Over 6 billion people consume milk worldwide! One glass of milk (250ml) is equivalent to 3.8km of driving a car! Milk is one of the main sources of nutrients for growing children, so we should be making sure the milk we're feeding the future generations won't continue to polute the Earth.</p>

                <img src="assets/milky_point.png">
                <p>Dairy milk uses the most water and land per litre of milk. If we all switched to plant based alternatives we could use the land in better ways! <a href="https://landcareaustralia.org.au/about/what-you-can-do-at-home-or-work-to-get-involved-in-landcare/">Read about how you can help the land here.<a></a></p>
