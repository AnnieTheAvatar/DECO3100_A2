            <h2>Why Milk?</h2>
            <p>Milk is one of the most common food resources. Over 6 billion people consume milk worldwide! <a href="https://www.fao.org/dairy-production-products/products/en/" class="source"><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i></a></p>
            <p>The amount of co2 emissons that is produced from one glass of milk (250ml) is equivalent to driving a car for 3.8km.<a href="https://www.co2everything.com/category/drinks" class="source"><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i></a></p>
            <p>Milk is one of the main sources of nutrients for growing children, so let's make sure the milk we're feeding the future generations won't continue to polute the Earth.</p>

                <h3>Water Usage</h3>
                <p>Did you know that producing dairy milk requires a lot of water?</p>
                <p>Cows, just like us, need water to stay healthy and produce milk. On top of that, the crops that cows eat, like grass and grains, also need water to grow. All this water adds up and can put a strain on our water resources, especially in
                    areas where water is already scarce. </p>
                <p>So, it's important for us to be mindful of how much water goes into producing milk.

            <div class="left">
                <h3>Land Usage</h3>
                <p>Cows need space to graze and eat grass, and that requires large pastures.</p>
                <p>Sometimes, forests and other natural habitats are cleared to make room for these pastures. This can harm the environment by contributing to deforestation and the loss of animal homes. </p>
                <p>Additionally, cows also eat crops like corn and wheat, which require land for cultivation. When more land is used for growing cow food, it can lead to more deforestation and the loss of biodiversity.

                <p>Cows can produce a gas called methane, which is another greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming.</p>
                <p>The transportation of milk from farms to stores requires vehicles that emit CO2. </p>
                <p>Additionally, the machines and factories used to process milk also release CO2.</p>
                <p>So, overall, the production of dairy milk contributes to the release of CO2 into the environment. If there's too much CO2, our Earth might just look like this! <strong><i
